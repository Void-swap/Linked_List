# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Implement a linked list and perform the following operations:<br>
**1. Insert at the start:** Add a new node to the beginning of the linked list.<br>
**2. Insert at the End:** Add a new node to the end of the linked list.<br>
**3. Insert at a Specific Position:** Add a new node at a specified position in the linked list.<br>
**4. Delete from the start:** Remove and return the node from the beginning of the linked list<br>
**5. Delete from the End:** Remove and return the node from the end of the linked list.<br>
**6. Delete at a Specific Position:** Remove and return the node at a specified position in the linked list.<br>
**7. Search:** Check if a specific element is present in the linked list.<br>
**8. Display:** Display the elements of the linked list.<br>
Ensure that you have methods to handle cases where the linked list is empty or when attempting to delete from an empty list.<br>

## EXAMPLE
For example, given an initially empty linked list, perform the following operations:<br>

1. Insert elements 10, 20, 30 at the beginning of the linked list.<br>
2. Insert elements 40, 50 at the end of the linked list.<br>
3. Insert element 35 at the specific position 3 in the linked list.<br>
4. Delete a node from the beginning of the linked list.<br>
5. Delete a node from the end of the linked list.<br>
6. Delete a node from the specific position 2 in the linked list.<br>
7. Search for element 20 in the linked list.<br>
8. Display the current state of the linked list after each operation.<br>

Write a program to simulate these operations and display the state of the linked list.
