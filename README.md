# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Implement a linked list and perform the following operations:<br>
<b>Insert at the start:<b> Add a new node to the beginning of the linked list.<br>
<b>Insert at the End:<b> Add a new node to the end of the linked list.<br>
<b> at a Specific Position:<b> Add a new node at a specified position in the linked list.<br>
<b> from the start:<b> Remove and return the node from the beginning of the linked list<br>
<b>Delete from the End:<b> Remove and return the node from the end of the linked list.<br>
<b>Delete at a Specific Position:<b> Remove and return the node at a specified position in the linked list.<br>
<b>Search:<b> Check if a specific element is present in the linked list.<br>
<b>Display:<b> Display the elements of the linked list.<br>
Ensure that you have methods to handle cases where the linked list is empty or when attempting to delete from an empty list.<br>

# EXAMPLE
For example, given an initially empty linked list, perform the following operations:<br>

1. Insert elements 10, 20, 30 at the beginning of the linked list.<br>
2. Insert elements 40, 50 at the end of the linked list.<br>
3. Insert element 35 at the specific position 3 in the linked list.<br>
4. Delete a node from the beginning of the linked list.<br>
5. Delete a node from the end of the linked list.<br>
6. Delete a node from the specific position 2 in the linked list.<br>
7. Search for element 20 in the linked list.<br>
8. Display the current state of the linked list after each operation.<br>

Write a program to simulate these operations and display the state of the linked list.
